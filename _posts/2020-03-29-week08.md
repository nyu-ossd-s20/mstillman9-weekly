title: Week 8

Our group, Group 12, finally settled on freeCodeCamp for our project. Before spring break, we had tentatively selected OpenFoodFacts as our project, but we decided to change it this week. freeCodeCamp was one of the projects that I evaluated for the project evaluations. In that evaulation, I mentioned that it was possible for a group to do that project for a few weeks.  I have never contributed to freeCodeCamp (or any public open-source project for that matter) before, but I am familiar with the MERN stack from taking AIT last semester.  In addition, some parts of the codebase don't require JS knowledge. The coding challenges are written mostly in Markdown, which is pretty easy. So we plan to work on freeCodeCamp, look at some issues, and possibly create a coding challenge.
