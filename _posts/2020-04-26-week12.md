So far, our project has been coming along good. We have gotten a second pull request in, the one that fixes some outdated instructions in a challenge about MongoDB Atlas.  We have all gotten freeCodeCamp to work locally, so we can easily work on issues.   The regex pull request that I did is probably blocked by a code freeze, so we might not get to see it merged soon.  Other than that, we are doing okay and making progress. 

In class, we have talked about how businesses can capitalize around open source software. Despite the common belief that it is impossible to do so, many companies have been successful in creating a business model around open source software. Usually it's done by them supplying services (such as Red Hat or Wordpress), or making part of their software, such as their core, open source (like Mac OS X).
