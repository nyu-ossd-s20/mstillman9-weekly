My group, group 10, worked on an extension that changes the font of any website.  The extension was written in HTML/CSS/JS, which I was mostly familiar with. The new things I did learn were the APIs that were specific to Firefox WebExtensions, which are necessary to build such an extension. The other groups' extensions did simple things, such as adding info to the pages or altering text on the page.
