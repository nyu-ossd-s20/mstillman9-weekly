title: Week 5

There have been a lot of evaluations for very different projects. Some projects, according to their evaluators, should be easy to contribute to. Other projects would be harder to contribute to in the timeframe of a few weeks. I do not think I am ready to select a project yet. The talk this week was about open data, the formats that it is in, how to parse it, how to find such data, etc. It was very interesting.
