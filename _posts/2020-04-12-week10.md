The standup reports were today. Many of the projects are very interesting, and they are making progress with their projects.  We are not the only group that is working on freeCodeCamp; there is another group that is working on it as well. In our group so far, we have been given a go-ahead to start working on 2 issues, one fixing some outdated instructions, and another fixing a regex.  I have looked at the issues and see potential solutions, but we don't have write access to our fork so I cannot open pull requests yet. 

Wikipedia is one of the largest open-source projects in existance. Most people have heard of Wikipedia before. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit. Wikipedia has had many uses for me. When I am looking up a subject on Google, Wikipedia is often one of the first links on the page, and almost always has useful information for me. I have also (admittingly) used Wikipedia for some research projects.  They have a list of references on the bottom of the page, which leads me to good resources for research projects. So Wikipedia is pretty useful for me.
