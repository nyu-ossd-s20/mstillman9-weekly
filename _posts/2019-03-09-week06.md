I have evaluated two projects so far for the project evaluations. Both are web applications but are drastically different.  I evaluated FreeCodeCamp, which supplies free coding tutorials. FreeCodeCamp runs on a MERN stack (JavaScript), and Markdown based templates for their coding challenges. This shouldn't be too hard for those that are familiar with JS already (those, like me, that have taken AIT). I also have evaluated MediaWiki, the software that runs Wikipedia. This runs on the LAMP stack (PHP), running on a normal web server. It is a very large and busy project, but there are some easy first issues that can be worked on. I am familiar with PHP, so this could be a possibility.
