title: Week 11
---

This week in class, we have explored many open efforts regarding the coronavirus.  We looked at multiple projects, which range from open design documents for things such as ventilators, open source projects, and open datasets such as New York's dataset of infections. It is great to see that so many people are doing these projects for the greater good.

With regards to our group project, freeCodeCamp, we have been making good progress this week.  We have found more issues.  We have contacted the team about adding a coding challenge, and have heard back from them, so creating a challenge is a possibility.  We have found another issue involving failing code on the legacy Microsoft Edge. I have completed the regex issue, and we have opened a pull request to fix it. It has been approved and just has to be merged.
